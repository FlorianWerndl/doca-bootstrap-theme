# doca-bootstrap-theme

[Twitter Boostrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) based theme for doca.

It's supposed to be used in combination with doca - a tool that scaffolds API documentation based on JSON Schemas.

## Usage

```
npm install -g doca
doca bootstrap
```

That creates a new API documentation with `doca-bootstrap-theme` as a dependency.
